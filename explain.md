# This is a recording about C plus plus's studying in C++ primer.

## We do not use normal page chapter.For example,chapter one is turly chapter two.And so on.

## ==*C++ primer plus*==


 ## *chapter ONE*
In this chapter,we learn how to use C++ to build basic program.
We can use **"namespace"** and **"function"** to realize some easy programs by writing cout or cin words,we can learn C++ io's way.

## *chapter TWO*
In C++,we have a lot of type to define the number.For example,we can define
**//--int(int,short,long,long long,unsign....)**
**//--float(float,double,long double)**
**//--char(char,sign char,unsign char)**

At same time,we can forced type conversion.But it can make the lose of the number

## *chapter THREE*
**In this chapter,we learn some Composite data type.**
For example,*strcut,union,pointer*.

**By the way,we also use some basic template to build our program.**
Such as ***vector*,*array***

We can use array templates to build array.For example,==*Array<int ,n>*==.
But the most important things is we can use **string** class to indentif the **char** type.
After that,we have a very useful way to build structure like array by using **new** and **delete**.

--For example,we can use ==*<<int *n= new int n>></int>*== or ==*<<int *n = new int[n]>></int>*== to build a int type.And we can use *delete* to destory it.That's very useful tool.

## *chapter FOUR*
In this chapter,we learn three basic cycle **{"for","while","do-while"}**.We don't explain the thoery of these cycles.But we should notice *for* and *while* is enter-cycle,*do-while* is out-cycle.

After that,we also use Comma Operator and Relational operators.For example,we can use **==<<for(j=0,i=word.size()-1;j<i;--i;++j)>>==**

We have two way to build type'other_name.One way is <<#define BYTE char>> that can replace char to BYTE when you want to use it.Other way we can use ==typedef typeName aliasName==

We can use ==cin.get(char)== to enter string with "space" or "\n" .....By the way,**cin.get()** actually is a member function which can receive one,no or any number.

On the other hand,use EOF can build file when we receive the "#" or other char by using bool.
--In the end,we learn how to build and use *double array* in C++.

## *chapter FIVE*
First,in this chapter we learn how to use **if-else** to build basic program.

After that,we can use functation libiary *cctype* to make string become from 'A' to 'a'.

And we also use **'ofstream'** and **'ifstream'** to finish the input and output in file.More details,we can use open way-=='fout.open() or outFile.open()'== and =='outFile.close()'==
By the way,we can use =='fin.open() and inFile.open()'==.....

## *chapter SIX*
We have know the basic element in C.

We can use **const** in function.The using of *const* can protect the element in function.It is a good way for us when we want to print or sort.

After that,the struct of C++ also can be used in function.For example,<<travel_time sum(travel_time t1,travel_time t2)>>.We also can build a transform the address of struct's function such as <<void show_polar(const polar *pda)>>.

Now we want to introduce the **string** and **array** in class.For example,<<void display(const string sa[],int n)>> and <<void fill(array<double,Seasons>*pa)>>

The function of pointer is a important tool.if <<double pam(int)>>,we can use <<double (*pf)int>> to build a function pointer.

Now we want to show you about a interesting thing in C++11.**auto** can guess the type of element when we use it.<<auto a = 12 //guess it is int type>>.There are more details in this photo.

#### ***typedef*** also is a easy tool when we want to clarify the program in C++.
